# Protein Graph Classification with GCN

This project utilizes **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for **protein graph classification**, focusing on identifying structural patterns, such as **cliques**, within protein subgraphs.  

## Key Features
- Preprocessing protein structures into graph representations.  
- Detection of **4-cliques** within subgraphs for structural analysis.  
- Implementation of **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)** for protein classification tasks.  
- Analysis and visualization of graph patterns to interpret protein interactions.  
- Evaluation of model performance on classification accuracy and graph structural metrics.
